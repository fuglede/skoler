# Skoler

This provides a simple dashboard for visualizing and comparing the grouped well-being indicators for Danish schools. The statistics are obtained from [BÃ¸rne- og Undervisningsministeriets Uddannelsesstatistik](https://uddannelsesstatistik.dk/Pages/Reports/1599.aspx), and for each school, we include the average responses grouped by the categories of the questionnaire.
